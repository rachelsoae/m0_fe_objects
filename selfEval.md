# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I had a moment of real frustration/weakness. I was feeling intimidated by the lesson and I have a really hard time learning by reading, so I was feeling foggy and lacking confidence going into this lesson. It honestly makes me a little nervous for getting through this program, knowing I'm going to have to advocate for myself and my learning style to help me out of those tough times. Luckily Jamie offered to hop on and help me, but I need to get better at asking for that help when it's clear I need it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I think I did a great job of setting boundaries around my time and space today. Keeping my office door closed when working on hard concepts is really important. Taking a long walk in the sunshine this afternoon was also really important.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
I learn best by seeing examples done in real-time. After driving for Objects in pair programming, it was all much easier to pick up. When I get stuck in the future, I should be brave about asking my peers to walk me through a chunk of their code so I can learn the concept, especially for lessons not taught in class.
